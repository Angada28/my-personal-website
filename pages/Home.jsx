        <h1>The Unseen Consequences: How Technology Shapes Our Lives and Privacy</h1>
        <img src="/title_pic.jpg" alt="Introduction" />
        <p>As technology continues to grow, it often helps us out in our day-to-day lives. From being able to connect with friends and family right away to swiftly accessing information, and now we are seeing big improvements with AI. While these are good changes to society they do have a cost and that is your privacy. The goal of this article is to help bring more attention to the issue of digital privacy.

        <h2>The Duality of Free Services</h2>
        <img src="/duality.jpg" alt="Duality of Free Services" />
        <p>Many of us use free services such as Facebook and Google to help us connect with others or to help us get an answer to some questions. Several of these free services provide users with information about inclement weather updates, for example warning users of an ice storm or other natural disasters. They also are important in spreading information about missing people as well. Oftentimes we can get advice on how to improve different parts of our lives through these free services.

        <p>As many are taking mental health more seriously than before, technology can help make it more accessible to others. In a study done by researchers at the universities of Iowa and Wisconsin-Madison, they were able to find many benefits and a few downsides to incorporating technology in mental healthcare. The article opens up by talking about different mediums that mental healthcare providers use when communicating with their patients. Through digital communication, they can reach out to patients in different ways such as email, text messages, over the phone, and through some apps. They also noted that the providers can work more efficiently through digital notes, this makes their notes more accessible and makes it easier to share with others if needed. However, with these benefits, many risks need to be considered when it comes to the privacy of their clients. There could be an unintentional leak of a patient's information which could breach or if a hacker were to attack the provider. It is important to consider privacy when dealing with technology to make things safer for the user.

        Sometimes technology can be used for nefarious acts. This can be seen with the Cambridge Analytica scandal which came to light back in 2018. The political consulting form was found to be misusing Facebook user data. The firm harvested personal information from millions of Facebook profiles without proper consent. This data was then used to create targeted political ads. These ads were used to influence many political events around the world with one of the most known ones being the 2016 US presidential election.

        Another case of free services being used negatively would be the January 6th insurrection which happened in the US as well. On January 6th, 2021 a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the US capitol with the goal being to disrupt the congressional certification of the election results for the 2020 election. Social media played a big part in this event. It was used to help organise and amplify the actions of those involved.

        <h2>How Your Privacy Is Violated</h2>
        <img src="/violate.jpg" alt="Privacy Violation" />
        <p>
        For many, privacy is the freedom from being observed by others. Many individuals believe that it is a fundamental right to be able to maintain their private lives that are separate from their public ones. Imagine browsing the internet one day at work and you get an ad for something very personal. This was the case for Bobbi Duncan who was a student at the University of Texas. Duncan was a closeted lesbian who tried to keep her sexual orientation a secret from her family but was outed through Facebook. This happened when she was added to a group by the president of the Queer Chorus. When Duncan was added this sent a message to her entire friend’s list which included family members. Here Duncan had no control over what happened here from being added to the group to having her entire friends list being updated about it. ( Angwin, Julia. Dragnet Nation).

        As Siva Vaidhyanathan has stated in several of his books, we are living in a cryptopticon. Unlike a panopticon where the people are aware they are potentially being watched, a cryptopticon is less intrusive in that it is far less obvious you are being watched, its very existence is supposed to go unnoticed. Unlike the panopticon where there is still a human element to the surveillance, the cryptopticon is completely algorithmic so it can collect more data on you than a human would. What many are not aware of is that all the free digital services you use have a hidden cost. 

        </p>
        <p>
        Have you ever wondered why companies like Facebook and Google have profits in the billions? While many would not know the answer some would say they make money by ads. However, if they were simply running ads like commercials on TV it would be a completely different story. These free services are always collecting extensive data on us. 

        </p>
        <p>
        You might be wondering how they exactly do this. As you use platforms like Facebook, Google, or things they own such as Instagram, they track and collect the things you do. They will then take that data and bundle it up once they have made a profile on you and sell it to advertisers, this is why you will often see Facebook ads for things you are interested in. While this might seem like they are providing you with content you enjoy, this is also being collected as well. One might think they are safe when they leave Facebook and Google's ecosystem, however, that is far from it. They will use 3rd party trackers to monitor you outside of their respective platforms through cookies. Cookies are small bits of text your browser stores from websites, this information contains your preferences. Through 3rd party trackers, they can continue to collect your data even in the real world. For example, if you’ve been getting ads about a new menu item at a restaurant, when you buy it 3rd party trackers will find out you did and continue to show you ads for it as it was successful. Through these ad practices companies like Facebook and Google can make about $52 per person

        <h2>How To Protect Yourself</h2>
        <img src="/project.png" alt="Protect Yourself" />
        <p>
        At this point, you may be wondering how do we protect ourselves online from these companies? While it is very hard to completely abandon these services as they are essential to many others as tech plays a huge part in society today. There are some potential solutions. Some may say that we need to rebuild these services from the ground up. This idea could work however the time it will take as well as the vacuum created by these companies halting all operations to restructure would allow other companies to take their place which would not help at all. 

        </p>
        <p>
        One way we can protect ourselves online is to be digitally literate. Digital literacy means being able to navigate technology as well as being able to participate responsibly while online. Some ways you can protect yourself online would be to review common privacy settings on websites. By reviewing what the website is allowed to collect on you it limits the data that gets collected on you. Another way to protect yourself online is to use a VPN. The word VPN stands for virtual private network and it protects you by encrypting all activities you do, making your actions mostly unreadable by those who wish to use it for malicious purposes.
        </p>

        While many would consider these tips to be common sense, I would instead like to ask how does one acquire common sense and if it is common why are many not aware of it? I believe that the reason most people aren’t aware of these tips is because most people are not explicitly taught how to be digitally literate and it is only those who have an interest in tech that usually consider these tips to be common sense.

        </p>
        <p>
        One of the bigger ways we can protect our privacy online is through legislation. Many would consider this idea pointless but it has worked in the past. This could best be seen in net neutrality. Internet service providers or ISPs wanted to allow rich websites to pay so they could load faster while other websites would be slowed down. However legislation was passed to ensure Internet Service Providers treat all sites the same. You might be wondering how legislation would help when it comes to digital privacy, there are a few ways it can help. 
One way it can help is through data protection laws. Through such laws, it would define standards on the collection, processing, and storage of personal data that companies must follow. By limiting how companies can collect personal data ads would become less invasive as they would have less data to work off of. 

        </p>
        <p>
        Another way legislation would help is by creating laws for user rights. This legislation would grant individuals the right to access the information companies have on their data. Should the user choose they could correct any incorrect data or they could choose to have their data removed from the company. 
        </p>
        <p>
        inally implementing laws that support transparency and accountability would go a long way in protecting our privacy online. By implementing such laws companies would have to explicitly tell users what they are collecting and how it will be used. That way users will be able to make a more informed decision on whether to give consent to such companies. Through such laws, companies would have to immediately notify users of any type of data leak so users can take appropriate action as early as possible instead of waiting months to even years for the company to notify them of such an event.

        </p>
        <p>
        Although this can take some time for legislation to be passed on digital privacy. If many were to gather and try to push for it, the process could be sped up.

        <h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
        <p>
        Now that we are at the end you might be thinking that having privacy is no longer possible through many of the things that free services do on the internet. While some of the things that happened such as what happened to Bobbi Duncan were unfortunate, there is still hope. While many say if you want to be safe and maintain digital privacy all you need is common sense, however, common sense is not something everyone knows when it comes to technology. This is not any user's fault as there was never any way to teach people about it. What we can do is start by educating people as specified above about basic ways to stay protected, but more can be done about that. What we should do is come together and demand more accountability from tech companies about what they are doing with our data as well as how they are collecting it. We can also try to have our government pass more legislation when it comes to digital privacy. If we can find ways to educate ourselves on these issues we can make things better going forward. One way that I do this is by being curious and asking even more questions about a topic. I hope you will do the same by looking into privacy areas that would be relevant to you.

        </p>
        <p>
        One way you can go about this is by checking Youtube or your favourite news source for information about digital privacy in today's world. One of my preferred ways is shows like Adam Ruins Everything. Technology has become a big part of our lives and instead of letting big tech corporations control our data, we should strive to learn as much as we can so that we can take control of our own data.
